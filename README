Open-source platform webgame

Author Danny Hendrix

This game gives an example of a setup for a HTML5 game. The game is written in Dart (http://www.dartlang.org/). 

Demo is available on http://www.dannyhendrix.com/dart/platformgame .

To improve performance, the level is buildup from tiles. Objects move from tile to tile, only the tiles that have changed are repainted each frame. 
Objects are pre-rendered on separate canvases.

More information on performance improvements used in this game:

Feedback is always welcome :).
